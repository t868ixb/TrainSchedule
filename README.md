# TrainSchedule
This website allows you to see all of the trains coming into the City of Bootcamp.  The City of Bootcamp was founded on 8/20/18 and has been growing ever since.  It's been growing so fast that we had to add more trains, with space to add more! 

# Getting Started
To get started with viewing the schedule, go here: https://t868ixb.github.io/TrainSchedule/
If you want to enhance the app, clone it and do your thing jellybean! 

# Prerequisites
The only thing you need to run this is a browser.  Chrome of course.  But, don't let anyone judege you if you're using something else --It's a free country and we should all support crazy.  

# Built With
html - The web pages the user will see and interact with
CSS - to style the page
javascript - to give it magic powers.  You know what's remarkable? Is how much England looks in no way like Southern California.
